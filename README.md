# Project Documentation

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
This code set explores a dataset containing information about SpaceX launches. It reads the dataset into a DataFrame, displays basic statistics, and creates visualizations to understand the success rate of SpaceX launches over time and the distribution of mission outcomes. The scatter plot helps visualize the relationship between payload mass and launch success.

# 2. Web Scraping and Data Visualization:
It demonstrates web scraping using BeautifulSoup to extract data from a webpage and then visualizes the scraped data using Plotly. The scraped data is cleaned and transformed into a DataFrame before visualizing it with interactive Plotly charts.

# 3. Data Preprocessing and Model Training:
This code preprocesses data and trains a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) using scikit-learn. It encodes categorical variables, splits the data into training and testing sets, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and classification report.

# 4. Data Visualization with Dash:
The focus is on creating an interactive web-based dashboard using Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch records. It reads the launch data into a DataFrame and constructs a Dash application layout with dropdowns, pie charts, and scatter plots. Callback functions are implemented to update visualizations based on user input.

# 5. Web Scraping and Data Preprocessing:
This code continues web scraping using BeautifulSoup to extract data from a webpage. The scraped data is cleaned and preprocessed to convert it into a structured format suitable for analysis or modeling.

# 6. Data Visualization with Dash (Continued):
It extends the development of the web-based dashboard using Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch records. Additional features like a range slider for payload selection are added to enhance interactivity. Callback functions are updated to incorporate user input from the range slider.

# 7. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
This code trains machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) using scikit-learn and performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. Pipelines are defined for each algorithm, and hyperparameters are optimized to improve model performance.

# 8. Model Evaluation and Visualization:
The focus is on evaluating and visualizing the performance of machine learning models trained in the previous code set. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to assess model performance, and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.
