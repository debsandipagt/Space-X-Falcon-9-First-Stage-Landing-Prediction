# Project Documentation

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Description: Performs exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about SpaceX launches.
Actions:
Reads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Displays basic information about the dataset.
Visualizes the success rate of SpaceX launches over time.
Creates a pie chart to show the distribution of mission outcomes.
Creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between payload mass and launch success.
Purpose: To understand the characteristics of the SpaceX launch dataset and explore relationships between variables.
# 2. Web Scraping and Data Visualization:
Description: Scrapes data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup and visualizes the scraped data using Plotly.
Actions:
Scrapes the desired data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup.
Cleans the scraped data and transforms it into a pandas DataFrame.
Visualizes the scraped data using Plotly to create interactive visualizations.
Purpose: To demonstrate web scraping and interactive data visualization using BeautifulSoup and Plotly.
# 3. Data Preprocessing and Model Training:
Description: Preprocesses data and trains a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
Actions:
Loads the dataset and preprocesses it by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Defines a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) and trains it on the training data.
Evaluates the trained model using accuracy and classification report.
Purpose: To demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn.
# 4. Data Visualization with Dash:
Description: Creates a web-based dashboard using Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch records.
Actions:
Reads the SpaceX launch data into a pandas DataFrame.
Creates a Dash application layout with dropdowns, pie charts, and scatter plots.
Implements callback functions to update visualizations based on user input.
Purpose: To build an interactive web dashboard for visualizing SpaceX launch records using Dash.
# 5. Web Scraping and Data Preprocessing:
Description: Demonstrates web scraping using BeautifulSoup and preprocesses the scraped data for further analysis.
Actions:
Scrapes data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup.
Cleans and preprocesses the scraped data, converting it into a structured format.
Performs additional data cleaning and preprocessing steps as necessary.
Purpose: To extract and preprocess data from web sources for further analysis or modeling.
# 6. Data Visualization with Dash (Continued):
Description: Continues the development of the web-based dashboard using Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch records.
Actions:
Implements additional features in the Dash application layout, such as a range slider for selecting payload range.
Updates callback functions to incorporate user input from the range slider.
Purpose: To enhance the interactivity and functionality of the web dashboard for visualizing SpaceX launch records using Dash.
# 7. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Description: Trains machine learning models using scikit-learn and performs hyperparameter tuning.
Actions:
Loads the dataset and preprocesses it for modeling.
Defines pipelines for different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN).
Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for each model.
Purpose: To train machine learning models, optimize hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance.
# 8. Model Evaluation and Visualization:
Description: Evaluates and visualizes the performance of machine learning models trained in the previous code set.
Actions:
Evaluates the trained models on the test dataset and generates confusion matrices and classification reports.
Visualizes model performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score using matplotlib and seaborn.
Purpose: To assess and compare the performance of different machine learning models based on various evaluation metrics.
