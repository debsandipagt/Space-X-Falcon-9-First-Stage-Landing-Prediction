Creates a pie chart to show the distribution of mission outcomes.
Creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between payload mass and launch success.
Purpose: To understand the characteristics of the SpaceX launch dataset and explore relationships between variables.
Web Scraping and Data Visualization:

Description: This code set scrapes data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup and visualizes the scraped data using Plotly.
Actions:
Scrapes the desired data from a webpage using BeautifulSoup.
Cleans the scraped data and transforms it into a pandas DataFrame.
Visualizes the scraped data using Plotly to create interactive visualizations.
Purpose: To demonstrate web scraping and interactive data visualization using BeautifulSoup and Plotly.
Data Preprocessing and Model Training:

Description: This code set preprocesses data and trains a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
Actions:
Loads the dataset and preprocesses it by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
Defines a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) and trains it on the training data.
Evaluates the trained model using accuracy and classification report.
Purpose: To demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn.
Data Visualization with Dash:

Description: This code set creates a web-based dashboard using Dash for visualizing SpaceX launch records.
Actions:
Reads the SpaceX launch data into a pandas DataFrame.
Creates a Dash application layout with dropdowns, pie charts, and scatter plots.
Implements callback functions to update visualizations based on user input.
Purpose: To build an interactive web dashboard for visualizing SpaceX launch records using Dash.
Web Scraping and Data Preprocessing:

Description: This code set demonstrates web scraping using BeautifulSoup and preprocesses the scraped data for further analysis.
Actions:
